# TelegramBotAlbum
An album bot that takes 2 to 5 photos on Telegram, creates folders with the name you want, and then you can request those photos by specifying a folder or store them on your device. The code is test, but it can be fine-tuned for the functions you need.
Nickname of bot - https://t.me/mo2DerAtor1boT
But you need change path in code, string 54 in file (where files will be save, the better way save it near main.py)
After that, you can launch file :)
